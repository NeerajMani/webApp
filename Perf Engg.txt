b. Define the pipeline stages, such as Build, Deploy, and Test.

i. In the pipeline configuration, define the stages that you want to include in the pipeline.

ii. Typically, a pipeline for performance testing would include stages for Build (to compile the code), Deploy (to deploy the application to the test environment), and Test (to run the performance tests).

c. In the Test stage, add a new test step and select the "Performance Test" type.

i. In the pipeline configuration, add a new step to the Test stage and select "Performance Test" as the step type.

ii. Follow the instructions to configure the test step and connect it to your LRE instance.

d. In the test configuration, select LRE as the test tool and provide the connection details for the LRE instance.

i. In the test configuration, select LRE as the test tool and provide the connection details for the LRE instance.

ii. You may need to provide the URL of the LRE instance, the login credentials, and other required settings.

e. Specify the test scenarios to run.

i. In the test configuration, specify the test scenarios that you want to run as part of the performance test.

ii. You can specify the test scenarios by referencing the scripts that you've uploaded to LRE.

f. Configure the test output settings, such as the report format and destination.

i. In the test configuration, specify the settings for the test output, such as the report format and the destination for the test results.

ii. You can configure Harness to generate reports in various formats, such as HTML, PDF, and JUnit.

Set up the pipeline trigger in Bitbucket
a. In the Bitbucket repository, create a new pipeline trigger.

i. In the Bitbucket repository, click "Settings" and select "Pipelines."

ii. Click "Create pipeline trigger" and follow the instructions to configure the trigger.

b. Configure the trigger to run the pipeline when changes are made to the repository.

i. In the pipeline trigger configuration, specify the events that should trigger the pipeline, such as a push to the repository or a pull request.

ii. You can also specify the branches and paths that should trigger the pipeline.

c. Specify the pipeline to run and the parameters to pass to the pipeline.

i. In the pipeline trigger configuration, specify the pipeline that should run when the trigger is activated.

ii. You can also specify the parameters that should be passed to the pipeline, such as the branch and commit ID.

Test the pipeline
a. Make changes to the code in the Bitbucket repository to trigger the pipeline.

i. Modify the code in the Bitbucket repository and commit the changes.

ii. Verify that the pipeline trigger is activated and that the pipeline is running.

b. Monitor the pipeline status and output.

i. In the Harness dashboard, monitor the status of the pipeline and the test output.

ii. If the test fails, analyze the test results to identify the issues and fix the code.

c. Repeat the process until the pipeline is running successfully.

i. Iterate on the pipeline configuration and the test scenarios until the pipeline is running successfully and producing accurate test results.

ii. Continuously monitor the pipeline and the application performance to identify issues and optimize the performance.


---To install the LRE plugins for Bitbucket, you will need to follow these general steps:

Go to the Bitbucket marketplace (https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?query=loadrunner) and search for the "LoadRunner Enterprise" plugin.

Once you find the plugin, click on the "Get it now" button to begin the installation process.

You will be prompted to log in to your Bitbucket account if you haven't already.

Follow the instructions provided to install the plugin. You will need to have the necessary permissions to install plugins for your Bitbucket instance.

After installation, the plugin should be visible in the "Add-ons" section of your Bitbucket settings.

In the "Add-ons" section, you will need to configure the plugin by providing the necessary connection details, such as the URL and credentials for your LRE instance.

Once the plugin is installed and configured, you should be able to connect LRE to your Bitbucket repository.

Please note that the above steps may vary depending on the version of Bitbucket and LRE you are using and the specific plugin you are installing. It's always a good idea to check the documentation provided by the plugin developer for more detailed instructions.
