Hello and welcome to this micro training video on non-functional requirements in performance testing. In this video, we'll discuss the importance of non-functional requirements in performance testing, and how to effectively incorporate them into the testing process.

First, let's review what non-functional requirements are. Non-functional requirements are the attributes of a system that define how it should perform. These requirements can include factors such as scalability, reliability, security, usability, and performance. They are essential to ensuring that an application not only functions as expected but also meets the needs and expectations of its users.

Incorporating non-functional requirements into performance testing is crucial to identify and mitigate any issues that may arise with the system's performance. By doing so, businesses can ensure that their applications can handle the expected loads and usage patterns, minimizing the risk of negative impact on user experience, and avoiding costly downtime.

Now, let's talk about why non-functional requirements are important in performance testing. Non-functional requirements help ensure that the application is not only functional but also performs well under different scenarios. By testing for these requirements, you can identify potential issues and ensure that the application meets the needs of its users.

To effectively incorporate non-functional requirements into performance testing, you need to follow a structured process that begins with identifying the relevant requirements. This requires a deep understanding of the business requirements, user expectations, and other factors that may impact the system's performance.

Once the non-functional requirements are identified, performance scenarios need to be defined. These scenarios should represent realistic usage patterns and load levels, and be designed to put the system under stress to ensure that it meets the necessary performance benchmarks.

Next, performance tests must be designed to validate the non-functional requirements. These tests may include load testing, stress testing, endurance testing, or other types of performance testing, depending on the requirements identified. The tests should be conducted under various conditions to ensure that the system can handle different usage patterns and load levels.

Once the performance tests are completed, the results must be analyzed to determine whether the non-functional requirements have been met. If any issues are found, they should be addressed promptly to ensure that the system meets the necessary performance benchmarks.

Finally, the results and analysis of the performance tests should be reported to stakeholders, including business leaders and development teams. The report should outline the non-functional requirements tested, the performance scenarios used, and the results of the tests. This information can be used to guide further development and ensure that the application meets the business needs and expectations.

In conclusion, incorporating non-functional requirements into performance testing is essential to ensure that an application functions as expected, meets user expectations, and performs well under different scenarios. By following a structured process, businesses can minimize the risk of negative impact on user experience and avoid costly downtime.

Hello and welcome to this training video on designing scenarios for peak hour testing in LoadRunner Enterprise. In this video, we'll discuss what peak hour testing is, why it's important, and how to effectively design scenarios for this type of testing in LRE.

Peak hour testing is a type of performance testing that simulates high loads during peak usage hours to ensure that an application can handle the expected traffic. It is important to perform peak hour testing because it can help identify and mitigate any issues that may arise when the application is under high load, ensuring that the application performs well even during periods of high usage.


Hello and welcome to this training video on designing scenarios for disaster recovery (DR) testing. In this video, we'll discuss what DR testing is, why it's important, and how to effectively design scenarios for this type of testing.

DR testing is a type of testing that simulates a disaster or failure scenario, such as a server crash or data center outage, to ensure that the IT infrastructure can recover and continue to function in the event of such a disaster. DR testing is important because it can help identify and mitigate any weaknesses or vulnerabilities in the IT infrastructure, ensuring that critical business functions can be resumed quickly and smoothly in the event of a disaster.

Hello and welcome to this training video on designing scenarios for failover testing. In this video, we'll discuss what failover testing is, why it's important, and how to effectively design scenarios for this type of testing.

Failover testing is a type of testing that simulates a failure scenario, such as a server crash or network outage, to ensure that the IT infrastructure can failover to a secondary system and continue to function. Failover testing is important because it can help identify and mitigate any weaknesses or vulnerabilities in the IT infrastructure, ensuring that critical business functions can be resumed quickly and smoothly in the event of a failure.

Hello and welcome to this training video on designing scenarios for endurance testing. In this video, we'll discuss what endurance testing is, why it's important, and how to effectively design scenarios for this type of testing.

Endurance testing, also known as longevity testing or soak testing, is a type of performance testing that is used to evaluate how an application or system performs over an extended period of time under sustained load. Endurance testing is important because it helps identify and mitigate any performance or stability issues that may occur over time, ensuring that the application or system can handle sustained usage without experiencing any issues.

Hello and welcome to this training video on designing scenarios for stress testing. In this video, we'll discuss what stress testing is, why it's important, and how to effectively design scenarios for this type of testing.

Stress testing is a type of performance testing that is used to evaluate the behavior of an application or system under extreme load conditions. Stress testing is important because it helps identify and mitigate any performance or stability issues that may occur under high load, ensuring that the application or system can handle the expected workload without experiencing any issues.


Hello and welcome to this training video on result analysis in LoadRunner Enterprise. In this video, we'll discuss how to analyze the results of a performance test that has been executed in LoadRunner Enterprise.

Once a performance test has been executed in LoadRunner Enterprise, the results can be analyzed in the Analysis section of the platform. Here are the steps to analyze the test results:

Open the test results: To access the test results, navigate to the Analysis section of LoadRunner Enterprise and select the relevant test run. This will open the results in the Analysis window.

Identify the key performance indicators: The next step is to identify the key performance indicators (KPIs) that are relevant to the test. KPIs are the metrics that are used to measure the performance of the system under test, such as response time, throughput, and error rate.

Use graphs and reports to visualize the data: LoadRunner Enterprise provides a wide range of graphs and reports that can be used to visualize the test results. Use these tools to analyze the KPIs and identify any trends or patterns in the data.

Compare results to baselines and thresholds: To determine whether the system under test has performed as expected, compare the test results to the baselines and thresholds that were defined prior to the test. Baselines are the performance metrics that were observed in previous tests or in production, while thresholds are the acceptable ranges for the KPIs.

Identify and investigate any issues: If the test results indicate that there are performance issues, use the LoadRunner Enterprise tools to drill down into the data and identify the root cause of the issue. This may involve examining individual transactions, analyzing server logs, or reviewing network traffic.

By following these steps, you can effectively analyze the results of a performance test in LoadRunner Enterprise and identify any performance issues that need to be addressed.
